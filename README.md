# comment-scraping-and-analysis
An approach to grabbing comments (with beautiful soup) and running text analysis on them (with NLTK and Gensim). 

This is for comments that do not have ratings (or comments with uniform or unreliable ratings). It will produce a chart of the n most frequent terms and a LDA topic model (you'll have to apply topic categories yourself, as per the LDA norm).
